Hello
You are trapped in a maze...
with "Enter" you can spawn boxes if you need to have access to something.
with "E" you can move the "Lever" and open the gate and set yourself free.
Be careful! there are so many things that can threat your health.
Also there are healing balls here and there, touch the colorful cylinders so they fall down(if they are not accessible)...
Enjoy the game :)
